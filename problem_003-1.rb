### Problem:

# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600_851_475_143 ?

### Notes:

# In number theory, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, also called the
# unique factorization theorem or the unique-prime-factorization theorem, states
# that every integer greater than 1 is either prime itself or is the product of
# prime numbers

# Dividing a number by a relatively small number yields a larger number.
# Dividing by a relatively large number yields a small number. The crossover
# point is at the square root. Therefore, if a number cannot be divided by the
# primes from 2 to its square root, it is prime itself.

# 1) Need a method for determining a prime
# 2) Divide target number by increasing primes, determine if result is prime
